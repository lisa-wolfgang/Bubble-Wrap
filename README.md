# Bubble Wrap

A visual text bubble editor for Breath of the Wild.

- The tool simulates NPC dialogue and sign bubbles. The spacing and wrapping behavior have been tested for accuracy against a variety of the vanilla dialogue.
- Text is automatically wrapped, eliminating guesswork and providing instant visual feedback.
- Multiple bubbles can be simultaneously converted to the MSYT format with a single click or keyboard shortcut.
