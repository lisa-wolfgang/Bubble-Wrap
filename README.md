# Bubble Wrap

A visual text bubble editor for Breath of the Wild.

## Features

### Automatic text wrapping

The editor works just like a regular text box -- eliminating guesswork and providing instant visual feedback. The spacing and wrapping behaviors have been tested for accuracy against a variety of vanilla dialogue. NPC and sign dialogs are currently supported.

### Hassle-free control nodes

Say goodbye to extra and missing spaces in your text. Coloring, resizing, and adding pauses is as easy as selecting a portion of text and applying the desired effect. In addition, presets are available for the most common animation/sound control nodes, but with full support for custom values. When it comes time to export, the control nodes are intelligently inserted so minimal manual tweakage is required.

### Smart paste

Simply paste a set of dialogue from your planning document into a bubble -- the text will automatically be wrapped and broken into multiple bubbles based on line breaks. Plus, sneaky variants of apostrophes and other characters are weeded out and replaced with the correct in-game versions.

### Effortless MSYT export

When you're ready to use your text in your mod, simply hit the button or keyboard shortcut to export everything into a single MSYT text node and have it copied to the clipboard. Never type a `\n` again.

## Install

Bubble Wrap is a web app: no installation is required, and it works on all platforms. However, if your browser supports it, you may install it offline.
