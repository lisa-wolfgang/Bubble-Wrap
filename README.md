# Bubble Wrap

A visual text bubble editor for Breath of the Wild.

## Features

### Automatic text wrapping

The editor works just like a regular text box -- eliminating guesswork and providing instant visual feedback. The spacing and wrapping behavior have been tested for accuracy against a variety of vanilla dialogue. NPC and sign dialogs are currently supported.

### Smart paste

Simply paste a long passage separated by line breaks or a MSYT text node into a bubble -- the text will automatically be formatted based on punctuation. Plus, sneaky variants of apostrophes and other characters are weeded out and replaced with the correct in-game versions.

### Effortless MSYT export

When you're ready to use your text in your mod, simply hit the button or keyboard shortcut to export everything into a single MSYT text node and have it copied to the clipboard. Never type a `\n` again.

## Install

Bubble Wrap is a web app: no installation is required, and it works on all platforms. However, if your browser supports it, you may install it offline.
