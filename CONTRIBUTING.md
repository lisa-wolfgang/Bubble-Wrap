Pull requests are welcome! However, it is recommended to open an issue first, especially for feature additions, to allow for prior discussion.

When developing, work against the `develop` branch to ensure compatibility with the latest changes. The `release` branch is specifically for the latest "stable" version; as such, changes are never directly made there.

To run Bubble Wrap locally, you must use a local server. In Visual Studio Code, an easy way to do this is with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
