Pull requests are welcome! However, it is recommended to open an issue first, especially for feature additions, to allow for prior discussion. Also check the existing pull requests and the [roadmap](https://github.com/lisa-wolfgang/Bubble-Wrap/projects/1) to see if the feature/fix is already planned, in progress, or implemented. If something is planned but not yet in progress, feel free to work on it. Be sure to communicate this (via a draft pull request or some other means) to avoid others duplicating your work.

When developing, work against the `develop` branch to ensure compatibility with the latest changes. The `release` branch is specifically for the latest "stable" version; as such, changes are never directly made there.

To run Bubble Wrap locally, you must use a local server. In Visual Studio Code, an easy way to do this is with the [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension.
